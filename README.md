mask_rcnn for Weed detection
Some important files and models are too big to upload.

You can find more details of the project in maintenance manual and user manual.
I also deploy it on the Google Cloud. If you want to have a look, please feel free to contact jiaqihan1108@gmail.com and I can start the VM instance for you. 

Thanks!
